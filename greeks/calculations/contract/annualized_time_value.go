//
// Annualized Time Value
//
// The time value of the option divided by the strike price, then annualized.
//
// You can use annualized time value to develop an intuitive understanding of how much value the option market is adding to
// an in-the-money option beyond the intrinsic value. For example, if a stock is trading at $40 and a
// six month call on that stock with a strike price of $35 has an intrinsic value of $5 and a total
// value of $7, the time value ($2) divided by the strike is ($2/$40) = 5%. Annualizing that time value
// to a one year horizon on a continuously compounded basis yields 9.76% (2 Ã— ln(1 + 0.05)).
